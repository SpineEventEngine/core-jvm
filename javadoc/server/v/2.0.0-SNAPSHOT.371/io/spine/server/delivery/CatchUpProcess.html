In this phase the task is to understand when to stop reading the history and switch back to delivering the live events dispatched to the catching-up projections. To do so, a special <code>FINALIZING</code> status is introduced. Observed by <code>Delivery</code> it tells to perform a transition from dispatching <code>TO_CATCH_UP</code> events back to delivering those <code>TO_DELIVER</code>. See more on that below. </p><p>In this version of the process implementation, the turbulence period always equals 500 ms meaning that the catch-up starts its finalization when the event history is read up until <code>now - 500 ms</code>. </p><p>In its lifecycle, the process moves through the several statuses. </p><p>The process is created in this status upon receiving the <code>CatchUpRequested</code> event. The further actions include: </p><ul><li>A CatchUpStarted event is emitted. The target projection repository listens to this event and kills the state of the matching entities. </li><li>The status if the catch-up process is set to <a href=CatchUpStatus.html#IN_PROGRESS>IN_PROGRESS</a>. </li></ul><p>The process is created in this status upon receiving the <code>CatchUpRequested</code> event. The further actions include: </p><ul><li>A CatchUpStarted event is emitted. The target projection repository listens to this event and kills the state of the matching entities. </li><li>The status if the catch-up process is set to <a href=CatchUpStatus.html#IN_PROGRESS>IN_PROGRESS</a>. </li></ul><p>When the process is in this status, the event history is read and the matching events are sent to the <code>Inbox</code>es of the corresponding projections </p><p>The catch-up maintains this status until the history is read till the point in time, which is very close to the Time.currentTime(). When this time comes, the events arriving to the <code>EventStore</code> are very likely to be just-emitted in a live mode. Therefore, the process needs to decide whether to decide that the history is fully read, or to continue the traversal through the history. </p><p>At this stage the actions are as follows. </p><ul><li>The historical event messages are read from the <a href=../event/EventStore.html>EventStore</a> respecting the time range requested and the time of the last read operation performed by this process. The maximum number of the events read is determined by <a href=DeliveryBuilder.html#setCatchUpPageSize(int)>one of the Delivery settings</a>. </li><li>Depending on the targets requested for the catch-up, the events are posted to the corresponding entities. </li><li>Unless the timestamps of the events are getting close to the current time, an HistoryEventsRecalled is emitted, leaving the process in the <code>IN_PROGRESS</code> status and triggering the next round similar to this one. <p>If the timestamps of the events read on this step are as close to the current time as the turbulence period, the HistoryFullyRecalled is emitted. </p></li></ul><p>The process moves to this status when the event history has been fully recalled and the corresponding <code>HistoryFullyRecalled</code> is received. At this stage, the <code>Delivery</code> stops the propagation of the events to the catch-up messages, waiting for this process to populate the inboxes with the messages arriving to be dispatched during the turbulence period. Potentially, the inboxes will contain the duplicates produced by both the live users and this process. To deal with it, a deduplication is performed by the <code>Delivery</code>. See CatchUpStation for more details. </p><p>The historical data pushed by the catch-up is dispatched through a number of shards, each processed by the <code>Delivery</code> independently of each other. Starting to dispatch the events from a shard, <code>Delivery</code> reads the details of the ongoing catch-up processes. By interpreting the status of each catch-up, <code>Delivery</code> decides on the actions to apply to the historical events. For instance, the historical events dispatched from a catch-up which is already <code>COMPLETED</code> are considered junk and are immediately deleted. </p><p>Before moving to the catch-up completion, it is required to make sure every historical event has been seen and dispatched by the <code>Delivery</code>. So if the catch-up process is moved to the <code>COMPLETED</code> state too early, some historical events will get stuck in limbo, and will eventually be deleted. </p><p>It's important to understand that different shards may be processed at different speeds and potentially by different application nodes. Therefore, in order to switch to the <code>COMPLETED</code> status, a catch-up process must ensure that each shard was processed by the <code>Delivery</code> which witnessed the catch-up process in its <code>FINALIZING</code> state. Such evidence would mean that this <code>Delivery</code> run is at the point in time by which three things already happened: </p><ul><li>the catch-up process has emitted all the events from the history, </li><li>the catch-up process has sent HistoryFullyRecalled after the historical events, </li><li>all these events were dispatched already — otherwise, the process wasn't going to be in its <code>FINALIZING</code> state. </li></ul><p>In order to guarantee that prior to moving to the <code>COMPLETED</code> status, the catch-up process emits special ShardProcessingRequested events for each shard. The events are dispatched to a ShardMaintenanceProcess, which responds back by emitting ShardProcessed events. The <code>Delivery</code> knows about this special-case signals and appends the data in these events with its own picture of ongoing catch-up processes and their statuses. By receiving <code>ShardProcessed</code> events populated with this information the catch-up process knows which status was seen by the <code>Delivery</code> at the moment when it had been dispatching the events from a certain shard. </p><p>The actions at this stage are as follows. </p><ul><li>All the remaining messages of the matching event types are read <a href=../event/EventStore.html>EventStore</a>. In this operation the read limits set by the <code>Delivery</code> are NOT used, since the goal is to read the remainder of the events. </li><li>The LiveEventsPickedUp event is emitted. This allows some time for the posted events to become visible to the <code>Delivery</code>. </li><li>In the next round of delivery, the emitted LiveEventsPickedUp event is dispatched back to this process. By this time, the last batch of the historical events has already been sent to their destinations. However, not all of them may have been yet delivered due to their large number or to the I/O performance. To ensure that every historical event was seen by the <code>Delivery</code>, a special ShardProcessingRequested event is emitted for every shard involved into dispatching the historical events up until now. </li><li>Each ShardProcessingRequested event triggers the <code>Delivery</code> to read and dispatch the signals from a specific shard. Being sent, these events are dispatched to a special system ShardMaintenanceProcess serving as a handler. By reacting to a <code>ShardProcessingRequested</code>, the latter maintenance process emits a ShardProcessed event, telling that the <code>Delivery</code> has worked its way through the messages present in this shard. </li><li>The catch-up process handles each <code>ShardProcessed</code> event. By gathering the data from these events, the catch-up is able to tell when all the affected shards were fully processed by the <code>Delivery</code>. Once all shards are processed, a CatchUpCompleted event is emitted. </li></ul><p>Once the <code>CatchUpCompleted</code> event is received, the process moves to the <code>COMPLETED</code> status. At this point, some live events and some historical events which were located in the &quot;turbulence&quot; window are still paused for dispatching. To ensure they are processed in each shard, the catch-up emits a number of <code>ShardProcessingRequested</code> events again. By dispatching them, it makes sure that the <code>Delivery</code> observes the change of catch-up status to <code>COMPLETED</code> and moves onto de-duplicating and delivering the previously &quot;paused&quot; events. </p><p>After that, a normal delivery flow is resumed. The catch-up process stops its execution.</p></div>
